First, install go-wayland by
```
go install github.com/MatthiasKunnen/go-wayland/cmd/go-wayland-scanner@latest
```
XML files are downloaded from https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/tree/master/protocol.
Then go files are generated by commands like
```
go-wayland-scanner -i wlr-virtual-pointer-unstable-v1.xml -o virtual_pointer.go -pkg gowayland
```
